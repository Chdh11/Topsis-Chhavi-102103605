## Project description

# Topsis

for: *Project-1 (UCS654)* submitted by: *Chhavi Dhankhar* Roll no: *102103605* Group: *3CO22*

Topsis-Chhavi-102103605 is a Python library for dealing with Multiple Criteria Decision Making(MCDM) problems by using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution(TOPSIS).

## Installation

Use the package manager pip to install topsis.

```pip install Topsis-Chhavi-102103605```

## Usage
Enter csv filename followed by .csv extentsion, then enter the weights vector with vector values separated by commas, followed by the impacts vector with comma separated signs (+,-), and followed by path of the output csv file.

```Topsis sample.csv "1,1,1,1" "+,-,+,+" output.csv```
or vectors can be entered without " "

```Topsis sample.csv 1,1,1,1 +,-,+,+ output.csv```

But the second representation does not provide for inadvertent spaces between vector values. So, if the input string contains spaces, make sure to enclose it between double quotes (" ").

To view usage help, use

```topsis /h```

## Example

### sample.csv

A csv file showing data for different mobile handsets having varying features.

| Model | Storage (in gb)  | Camera (in MP)  | Price (in $) | Looks (out of 5) |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| M1    | 16               | 12              | 250          | 5                |
| M2    | 16               | 8               | 200          | 3                |
| M3    | 32               | 16              | 300          | 4                |
| M4    | 32               | 8               | 275          | 4                |
| M5    | 16               | 16              | 225          | 2                |



weights vector = [ 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.25 ]

impacts vector = [ + , + , - , + ]

### input:

```Topsis sample.csv "0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25" "+,+,-,+" output.csv```

### output:

## Other notes

The first column and first row are removed by the library before processing, in attempt to remove indices and headers. So make sure the csv follows the format as shown in sample.csv. All the categorical column are encoded to numerical values for processing.
